This site is being put together using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Hugo is in the words of its authors "The world's fastest framework for building websites".
Well, a claim like that deserves to be verified! I want something that lets me put a concept online
at the speed of light, that looks good and that gives me enough time to think at the next step
whenever there will be one to be taken.

The theme used in this site is not fixed, it is not given for granted.
I will experiment and change theme as I go on in the learning process. Most of the existing ones
can be found at: [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
