# Data Science day by day
[Data Science day by day](http://antonio-ferraro.eu5.net/) is my Data Science learning blog. In 2015, I started learning about Data Science and ML,
being a seasoned IT Professional it did not sound at all new to me. But I wanted to learn and to keep up to date with the most recent developments,

I wanted to brush up my stats and maths, I wanted to be current (or as current as I can). I haven't gained a lot of "practical" experience, but I have participated to several MOOCS gaining many certifications, I have learned the basis and a bit more of both Python and R, to the point of being capable of
"doing things with them" and I have also learned a few more things in the process. So, overall it was a very rewarding learning experience and it is far from being finished.
