# Developing Data Products

This is one of the MOOCs of the [JHU/Coursera Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). It is the course in which you familiarise with producing Data Science products that other people can use to explore the data, as well as producing interactive presentations from R using Rmarkdown.

- The presentation can be found on [Github](http://anfe67.github.io/DevDataProductsPres/)
- The little R/Shiny application can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://anfe67.shinyapps.io/DevDataProductsProj/)
