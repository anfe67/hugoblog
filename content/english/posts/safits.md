# SaF IT Services web site

A little bit over a year ago I founded, together with Fritz and Stefy our company, SaF IT Services. The web site  
is hosted by [Easyhost Belgium](https://easyhost.be) and is an extremely simple one, it is based on:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JS

I have used a free bootstrap template called [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/freelancer/) to implement the site,
for which the important parameters were :

1. Speed
2. Look (should not be too bad as I am not a designer but I can spot something ugly)
3. Content  

The site could be further optimized by slimming down the various js files that it imports and of which only a minimal part are used.
But it scores already way better than Wordpress sites at various sites that evaluate site load speeds and it does not look too bad!
