# Data Science Specialization - Capstone Project

This project is the closing chapter of the JHU / Coursera [Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) MOOC.
The Capstone project consisted in building an "intelligent keyboard", that tried to guess the next word based on what you type. It will also detect any bad language and clean it.

I took a slightly different approach to all implementations that I have seen, going for a solution where the datagram database is implemented in SQLLite.
In this way, I have experienced also database integration in R.

- The project "pitch" presentation can be found on [RPUBS](https://rpubs.com/anfe67/guessnextword)
- The application itself implemented in R/Shiny, can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://anfe67.shinyapps.io/guessnextword/), I have included
application notes and source code snippets for the most important parts as well.
