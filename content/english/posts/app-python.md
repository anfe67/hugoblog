# Apprenons Python

[Apprenons Python en jouant](http://apprenons-python.c1.biz/) is a website I built to keep track of a trip into teaching Python programming
to kids.

The site started as a way to respond to the innocent question from my son and one of his friends: _How do you write a video game_.

We started this trip a couple of years ago and since then we have explored the world of text based gaming,
graphics based gaming, web development, physical computing (with the raspberry pi) etc.

I am always a bit late in updating this site. The site itself is authored in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/),
it is entirely in French and and occupies some free space offered by [biz.nf](https://www.biz.nf/).

All software used on this site, the web space, the plugins, the theme sused are freely available software.
