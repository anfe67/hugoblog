# Idées Suspendues

The thema is the COVID-19 pandemy, and the will to restart in full safety. But we do not want the little economy, what we call the "Real" economy to
die due to this virus.

The site can be reached at [Idées Suspendues](https://ideessuspendues.be) and this is the idea behind:

{{< quote width="60%" >}}
After the stores reopen, we all wonder how restaurants will be able to adapt to the new safety standards to welcome their customers again ...
Two Belgian entrepreneurs, Thierry Lazzerini and Antonio Ferraro were interested in this question of the recovery of the economy a month ago and were inspired by an Italian project to create hanging ideas.
Do you have ideas that will allow businesses, businesses, restaurants, sports clubs but also schools… to resume their activity safely? Do not hesitate to share them.
We can all contribute to the revival of activities, just share your ideas ... By compiling your ideas, we may be able to help the local business to increase its sales, to receive new customers safely!
