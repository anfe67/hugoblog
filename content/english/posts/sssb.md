# SSSB and the SSSB Section  

The [NATO SSSB Program]("SSSB.jpg") is the place where I have spent most of my professional carrer. And since there is an online presence with a picture of myself on, I would like to mention it here.

Among the tasks I was in charge of there:

- Software Development (initially C then Java)
- System Analysis
- Hardware updates
- Helpdesk
- Training
- Test conduct and test support
- Quality control
- Project supervision
